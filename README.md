Currency Converter

This is a simple currency converter that allows you to quickly check the latest currency exchange rates.

Type http://localhost:5000/exchange in your browser to view the converter.

You can use this converter to check the actual rates if you want to buy or sell the selected currency.

The bid price is what the dealer is willing to pay for a currency, while the ask price is the rate at which a dealer will sell the same currency.
